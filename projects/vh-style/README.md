*ngx-vh-style* is an angular directive that allows to apply viewport height (VH) values in pixels, ensuring maximum browser compatibility.

```html
<div vhStyle='max-height: 100vh'></div>
```


## Purpose

Viewport height is usually referred to as the window's inner height in %.

However, browsers such as Chrome Mobile make their toolbar height count towards the viewport height, making the inner height inaccessible through CSS if the element is not relatively parented to the body â€” which can happen when using frameworks like [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com).
